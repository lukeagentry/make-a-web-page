    <h1>The Begining of HTML Programing</h1>
<div id="html">
    <h3>HTML & The Internet</h3>

<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  The web contains billions of HTML documents.  These documents are all stored on servers. When you "Google" something, your computer submits a <em>HTTP</em> request to a server.  The server finds the document you are looking for and sends that document to your computers browser. The browser interprets the page and displays it on your computer.<br><br>
All HTML documents are made up of boxes.  These boxes can contain images, content and even other shapes.  Front-end web developers look at all websites as if they are laid out in boxes.  It can be useful to take something as simple as a pencil to scetch out these boxes.  To make these boxes, a "div" tag is used at the begining and end of each box.</p>
</div>
<div id="tagsandelements">
<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>

<p>Tags and elements make up every page of HTML code. This is how computers read the documents. Computers are stupid in that they can't catch basic coding mistakes that a human can catch. They simply do what they are told to do by the coding within the HTML document. Therefore, having a period out of place or forgetting to close a tag can cause major problems.</p>

<div id="inlinevsblockelements">

<h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>

<p>Elements of an HTML document are either Inline or Block. The only major difference is that block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
</div>
<div id="googlechrome">
<h3>Google Chrome</h3>

<p>Google Chrome is a unique internet browser.  Whenever you open a internet page using Chrome, a menu appears in the upper right hand corner.  You can click on this menu and go to "tools".  From there you can go to "developer tools".  When you open developer tools on a webpage, you can see all of the HTML coding for that page.  This is a great tool when you are first starting to code.  By looking at existing code and changing the code, you can start to figure out how things are programed.</p>  
</div>
<div id="css">
<h3>CSS</h3>

<p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.  These style sheets are what is used to determing how a page looks on the internet.  You can control virtualy every aspect of a page if you know the correct CSS to use.  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">This page</a> can be used as a resource for looking up different CSS.  It would be almost impossible to learn every CSS variable, so it is common to use a website like this.

    <h3>Checking HTML and CSS Code</h3>

      <p><a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">This page</a> can be used for checking the formatting of your HTML coding.  At the bottom of the page, all of the errors in your HTML file will be revealed.  Also,<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">This page </a> can be used to make sure that you CSS coding is correct.</p>
